            <abstract>The Cincinnati Community Council Boundaries layer is an assemblage of maps of each distinct Cincinnati neighborhood. Community councils are nonprofit voluntary organizations that weigh in on city matters, but exist separately from the city government and follow different rules. Each neighborhood council has defined its own border which, in some cases, are not in agreement with other contiguous neighborhood boundaries resulting in areas of overlap within the layer. The City of Cincinnati does not intervene or mediate on these boundary discrepancies.</abstract>
